### React-design-pattern-practice

React design patterns help structure components, improve reusability, readability, and maintainability.

## 1. Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern

A function that takes a component and returns a new component.
Useful for cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth, etc.).

## 2. Render Prop Pattern

A technique where a component accepts a function that returns UI.
Great for reusing logic without inheritance
